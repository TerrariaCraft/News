			<h4><font color="#FFAAAA">&gt; Since Launcher v20.5.6.2 launcher now supports QR code scanning as an alternative to patreon codes, so you will no longer need to copy-paste the patreon code, you can just select it in DMs  with @TerrariaCraft Bot just as if you were making a screenshot!
(This feature is in BETA, hopefully everything is gonna work, but no promises on 100% reliability though)</font></h4>
			<h4><font color="#FFAAAA">&gt; Since Launcher v20.5.6.1 launcher now comes with a preinstalled JRE, which allows it to run in any windows environment!</font></h4>
